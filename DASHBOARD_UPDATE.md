# Dashboard Update - Real Data Integration

## Overview
The dashboard has been updated to use real data from Supabase instead of hardcoded mock data. This provides a more accurate and dynamic view of the equipment management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created DashboardService (`src/services/dashboardService.ts`)
- **DashboardStats**: Fetches real statistics from the equipment table
- **EquipmentStatusData**: Gets equipment status distribution for pie chart
- **MonthlyTrendData**: Retrieves equipment trends over the last 6 months
- **RecentActivityData**: Gets recent equipment activities (currently using sample data)
- **WarrantyWarningData**: Fetches equipment with expiring warranties

### 2. Updated Dashboard Components

#### EquipmentChart.tsx
- Now fetches real data from `DashboardService.getEquipmentStatusData()`
- Shows actual equipment status distribution
- Displays monthly trends based on real equipment data
- Added loading states for better UX

#### RecentActivity.tsx
- Updated to use `DashboardService.getRecentActivities()`
- Currently shows sample data (equipment_history table integration pending)
- Added proper loading and empty states

#### Dashboard.tsx (Main Page)
- Fetches real statistics using `DashboardService.getDashboardStats()`
- Shows actual equipment counts and percentages
- Displays real warranty warnings from `DashboardService.getWarrantyWarnings()`
- Added loading states and error handling

### 3. Database Integration

#### Real Data Sources
- **Equipment Table**: Main source for equipment statistics
- **Departments Table**: For department information in warranty warnings
- **Users Table**: For user information in activities

#### Sample Data
- Added equipment with expiring warranties for testing
- Created migration `010_add_expiring_warranty_equipment.sql`
- Equipment includes various warranty expiration scenarios

### 4. Features Implemented

#### Statistics Cards
- Total equipment count
- Normal equipment count with percentage
- Maintenance/damaged equipment count
- Warranty expiration warnings

#### Charts
- **Pie Chart**: Real equipment status distribution
- **Bar Chart**: Monthly equipment trends (last 6 months)

#### Recent Activities
- Currently shows sample data
- Ready for integration with equipment_history table

#### Warranty Warnings
- Shows equipment with warranties expiring within 60 days
- Color-coded by urgency (critical, warning, info)
- Displays days until expiration

## Technical Details

### Error Handling
- All service methods include try-catch blocks
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Console logging for debugging

### Loading States
- Added loading indicators for all data-fetching components
- Empty state handling for no data scenarios

### TypeScript Integration
- Proper type definitions for all data structures
- Interface definitions for database entities
- Type-safe service methods

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Equipment History Integration
- Complete integration with `equipment_history` table
- Real activity tracking and display
- User action logging

### 2. Real-time Updates
- Implement real-time subscriptions for live data
- Auto-refresh functionality
- WebSocket integration

### 3. Advanced Analytics
- Equipment utilization metrics
- Cost analysis and reporting
- Maintenance scheduling insights

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Data caching strategies
- Pagination for large datasets
- Optimized database queries

## Testing

### Sample Data
The system includes comprehensive sample data:
- 10+ equipment items with various statuses
- 8 departments
- 8 users with different roles
- Equipment with expiring warranties for testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Verify that statistics show real numbers
4. Check that charts display actual data
5. Confirm warranty warnings appear for expiring equipment

## Database Schema Requirements

### Required Tables
- `equipment`: Main equipment data
- `departments`: Department information
- `users`: User information
- `equipment_history`: Activity tracking (for future use)

### Required Fields
- Equipment: status, warranty_date, created_at
- Departments: id, name
- Users: id, first_name, last_name

## Notes

- The equipment_history table integration is pending due to TypeScript type generation issues
- Recent activities currently show sample data for demonstration
- All other features use real data from the database
- The system is designed to gracefully handle missing or incomplete data
